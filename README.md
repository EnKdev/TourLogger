TourLogger is a (small) companion tool for the circle of friends I have for whenever we play ETS2 & ATS, allowing them to log their tours into a central database.

Current features of TourLogger include:

-	Displaying all tours into a single table
-	Viewing a single tour inside a special window to have information packed into one package
-	Logging tours to a database, Refreshing the table directly afterwards
-	Saving an already on-going tour so drivers can pick up where they left in case they needed to take a break.

And much more! (Trust me, I been working on this for nearly 3 years already, and new shit still comes. Quite remarkable actually.)

## Additional notes

I might make a general release for everyone to use, however, that would require me to change a lot of the internal infrastructure.

If I get around to it, I might make it a local running instance that runs over a No-SQL Json App-Internal backend.
