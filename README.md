TourLogger is a (small) companion tool for players of ETS2 & ATS, allowing them to log their tours into a central database.

Current features of TourLogger include:

-	Displaying all tours into a single table
-	Viewing a single tour inside a special window to have information packed into one package
-	Logging tours to a database, Refreshing the table directly afterwards
-	Saving an already on-going tour so drivers can pick up where they left in case they needed to take a break.

And much more! (Trust me, I been working on this for nearly 2 years already, and new shit still comes. Quite remarkable actually.)
